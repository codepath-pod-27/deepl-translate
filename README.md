## Overview
### Description
Tweet or Comment in instagram or make a google search in any language that you want to. 


### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Reference
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer. Functionality of translate wouldnâ€™t be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version would be more practical for day to day use.
- **Story:** This would help expats from different countries engage with social media in the country that they are in. 
- **Market:** Marketed to cater to tourists.  Use case would be connecting non-English speakers to the internet in the US. Useful for international brands trying to cater to the local marketplace.
- **Habit:** This app can be used whenever a foreign language is encoutered for a brief 
- **Scope:** First we'll have people use it as hashtags on their post and hope provides enough publicity and if we get funding it would be used to develop app more and advertising.
